# 103CIPHER - Mathematical Message Masking - Multiplying Matrices

## Description
103CIPHER is a matrix-based encryption and decryption tool using the **Hill cipher** method. The program implements mathematical transformations, such as translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, using custom matrix operations. The encryption and decryption processes are performed manually without relying on external libraries like numpy.

This project focuses on understanding cryptography principles, matrix multiplication, and matrix inversion, and demonstrates how to apply these concepts in encryption algorithms.

## Features
- Matrix-based encryption using the Hill cipher.
- Decryption with matrix inversion.
- Implements mathematical transformations without relying on external libraries.
- Handles errors in matrix multiplication and decryption.

## Usage
To run the program, use the following command:
```bash
python3 103cipher.py "message" "key" flag
